# PreVizAI - AI-Powered Patient Intake System

A modern healthcare web application built with Next.js and Cedar OS for HackGT's Cedar OS sponsor track. This application streamlines pre-appointment patient intake through voice-powered AI conversations, allowing patients to describe their symptoms naturally and providing doctors with comprehensive intake reports.

## 🎯 Features

- **Voice-Powered Patient Intake**: Natural conversation with AI using Cedar OS voice capabilities
- **Doctor Dashboard**: Manage patients, send intake requests, and review reports
- **AI-Generated Medical Reports**: Structured summaries of patient conversations with key insights and suggested next-steps.
- **Knowledge Graph Visualization**: A graphical visualization of patients' symptoms, treatments, and condition using nodes.
- **Professional Healthcare UI**: Clean, accessible design following medical UI best practices
- **HIPAA-Mindful Data Handling**: Secure conversation storage and processing

## 🏗️ Application Flow

1. **Doctor Dashboard**: Doctor sends pre-appointment AI intake request to patient
2. **Patient Interface**: Patient receives notification and starts voice conversation with AI
3. **AI Conversation**: Natural dialogue where AI asks follow-up questions about symptoms
4. **Report Generation**: Conversation is processed into structured medical report
5. **Doctor Review**: Doctor receives notification and can view comprehensive patient report

## 🚀 Quick Start & Installation

### Prerequisites

   ```

   **Backend (backend/.env):**
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
   NEO4J_USER=neo4j
   NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_neo4j_password_here
   FLASK_ENV=development
   FLASK_DEBUG=True
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python run_server.py
   ```
   Backend available at: `http://localhost:5000`

## 🎮 Usage

### For Doctors:
1. Visit `/doctor` to access the dashboard
2. View upcoming appointments and patient statuses
3. Send intake requests to patients who need pre-appointment screening
4. Review completed intake reports with structured medical information

### For Patients:
1. Visit `/patient` to start the intake process
2. Click the microphone button to begin voice conversation
3. Describe your main health concerns naturally
4. Answer follow-up questions from the AI assistant
5. Complete and submit your intake when finished

## 🏥 Medical Report Structure

The AI generates structured reports including:
- Chief complaint in patient's own words
- Symptoms, duration, and severity
- Triggers and relieving factors
- Medical history and current medications
- Red flag symptoms requiring immediate attention
- Functional impact on daily activities
- Recommended follow-up actions

## 🔧 Cedar OS Integration

This application leverages Cedar OS for:
- Voice permission management
- Real-time speech-to-text conversion
- AI voice synthesis for responses
- Message store management
- Seamless conversation flow
