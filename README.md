## ✨ Project Vision
**PreVizAI** is a modern, HIPAA-mindful healthcare web app built with **Next.js** and **Cedar OS Voice Capabilities** to transform pre-appointment patient intake.

**The Problem**  
Traditional patient intake relies on long, static forms—slow and often incomplete. Doctors spend 15+ minutes on repetitive questions, risking misdiagnosis and frustrating patients.

**Our Solution**  
PreVizAI replaces forms with a natural **voice-powered AI conversation**. Patients speak freely; the AI (powered by **OpenAI GPT-4**) asks smart follow-ups. Their answers become a structured **medical report** so doctors start appointments already informed.

## 🎯 Key Features & Cedar OS Integration

| Feature | Description | Cedar OS / AI Technology | Impact for Healthcare Providers |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Voice-Powered Intake** | Patients describe symptoms naturally in a clean interface. | Cedar OS (real-time Speech-to-Text & AI voice synthesis) | Captures rich, natural data and improves accessibility. |
| **AI-Generated Medical Reports** | Converts conversations into structured reports with chief complaint, history, and key insights. | OpenAI GPT-4 API | Saves clinician time and provides ready-to-use clinical insight. |
| **Doctor Dashboard** | Central hub to send intake requests and review reports. | Next.js / TypeScript | Streamlines workflow and highlights high-priority patients. |
| **Knowledge Graph Visualization (optional)** | Visual graph of symptoms, conditions, and treatments. | Neo4j Graph DB | Reveals complex clinical connections for advanced diagnostics. |
| **HIPAA-Mindful Design** | Secure handling of sensitive data. | Flask Backend + Secure Architecture | Ensures compliance and builds patient trust. |

## 🏗️ Application Flow: From Request to Report
1. **Doctor Action 👨‍⚕️** – Doctor sends a pre-visit intake request from the `/doctor` dashboard.  
2. **Patient Interface 📲** – Patient opens `/patient` and begins the Cedar OS-powered voice dialogue.  
3. **AI Conversation 🗣️** – Cedar OS transcribes speech; GPT-4 asks smart follow-ups (duration, severity, history, red flags).  
4. **Report Generation 📝** – Flask backend turns the transcript into a structured **Medical Report**.  
5. **Doctor Review ✅** – Doctor reviews the report before the appointment, reducing visit time and improving accuracy.

## 💻 Tech Stack & Architecture

| Area | Technology | Reason |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS | Fast, server-rendered, type-safe web app. |
| **Core UI** | Cedar OS Components, Lucide React Icons | Accessible, professional healthcare UI. |
| **Voice & AI** | Cedar OS SDK, OpenAI GPT-4 API | High-fidelity voice interaction + world-class language processing. |
| **Backend** | Flask (Python API) | Lightweight and flexible for AI/ML logic & secure data processing. |
| **Database (optional)** | Neo4j | Ideal for representing complex symptom-condition relationships. |

## 🚀 Quick Start & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ & npm  
- Python 3.11+ & pip  
- **OpenAI API Key**  
- Git  
- Neo4j (optional for Knowledge Graph)

### 1️⃣ Clone & Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd PreVizAI   # or the folder name where you cloned the repo

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# (Optional) Create Python virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows (PowerShell)
# .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install backend dependencies
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
2️⃣ Configure Environment Variables
Create the following files and add your credentials.

Frontend — .env.local in the repo root:

ini
Copy code
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
Backend — backend/.env:

ini
Copy code
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
# Neo4j settings are optional if you are not using the Knowledge Graph
NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
NEO4J_USER=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_neo4j_password_here
FLASK_ENV=development
FLASK_DEBUG=True
Security note: Never commit .env.local or backend/.env. Add them to .gitignore.

3️⃣ Run the App
Open two terminals.

Backend

bash
Copy code
cd backend
# activate virtualenv if you created one
# source .venv/bin/activate   (macOS/Linux)
python run_server.py
# Backend running at: http://localhost:5000
Frontend

bash
Copy code
# from repo root (where package.json lives)
npm run dev
# Frontend running at: http://localhost:3000
🎮 Usage Guide
For Doctors
Visit: http://localhost:3000/doctor

Send intake requests to patients.

Review completed reports and explore the Knowledge Graph (if enabled).

For Patients
Visit: http://localhost:3000/patient

Click the microphone to start Cedar OS voice intake.

Describe symptoms naturally and answer follow-up questions.

Submit when finished — doctor receives the report.

📄 Medical Report Structure
The AI generates a structured document that includes:

Chief Complaint – patient’s primary concern in their own words

History of Present Illness (HPI) – duration, severity, onset, context

Triggers & Relieving Factors – diagnostic clues

Medical History & Medications

Red Flag Symptoms – urgent warning signs

Functional Impact – effect on daily life

Recommended Follow-up Actions – suggested next steps
