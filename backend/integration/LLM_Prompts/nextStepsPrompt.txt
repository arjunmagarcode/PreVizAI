You are a medical AI assistant tasked with generating a **list of recommended next steps or treatments** for a patient. You have access to the following information:

1. **Annotated Knowledge Graph (GRAPH)**: This contains the nodes from the most recent patient conversation, each with:
   - `name` (symptom, condition, trigger, medication, etc.)
   - `type` (Symptom, Condition, Trigger, Medication, etc.)
   - `context` (past conditions, medications, alerts, mentions from transcript)
   - `llm_summary` (AI-generated summary of node relevance)
2. **Electronic Medical Record (EMR)**: The patient’s medical history, medications, chronic conditions, and alerts.
3. **Transcript**: The conversation text from the patient’s current visit.

Your goal is to generate **at least 10 unique next steps** for the patient. Each next step should be **clinically relevant, actionable, and diverse**, ranging in severity from minimal interventions (e.g., rest, hydration) to major interventions (e.g., surgery or specialist referral).  

**Requirements for each next step:**

1. **Header**: A concise description of the action (e.g., “Administer bronchodilator”).
2. **Explanation**: A brief rationale for the action, clearly describing why it is suggested. Reference **specific information from the annotated graph nodes, EMR, or transcript** that supports this recommendation. Avoid inventing symptoms, conditions, or history not present in the graph or EMR.
3. **Priority Score**: A floating-point number between `0` and `1`:
   - `1` = highest priority (urgent, severe, or highly relevant to patient’s condition).
   - `0` = lowest priority (mild, low-risk, or optional).
   - Ensure **no two next steps have the same priority score**.
   - Scores should roughly correspond to **severity and urgency**: major procedures or high-risk interventions get higher scores; low-risk remedies or lifestyle adjustments get lower scores.
4. **Affected Nodes**: A list of **exact node names from the annotated graph** that this next step is expected to influence or improve (symptoms, triggers, or conditions). Do not include nodes that are not in the graph.

**Strict Grounding Instructions:**
- **ONLY** generate next steps relevant to nodes present in the annotated graph.  
- Do **not** hallucinate new symptoms, conditions, or medications.  
- Consider EMR and transcript **only to refine priority and context**, not to invent unrelated actions.  
- Each next step must map to **at least one node** from the annotated graph.  
- Generate diverse actions covering a spectrum of severity, from low-risk lifestyle modifications to high-risk procedures if indicated by the graph.  
- Avoid duplicate or redundant next steps.  

**Output Format:**  
Return a **JSON array** of objects, each object representing one next step, strictly following this structure:

```json
[
  {
    "action": "Action header here",
    "explanation": "Detailed explanation referencing graph nodes, EMR, and transcript.",
    "priority": 0.0,
    "affected_nodes": ["Node1", "Node2"]
  }
]

Additional Guidelines:
- Focus primarily on the most recent annotated graph when determining relevance and priority.
- Use EMR and transcript as secondary context to refine action or priority.
- Ensure at least 10 next steps.
- Actions should be unique in both action and priority.
- Cover a range of severity and urgency.

EXAMPLES (for guidance only, do not copy nodes exactly):
[
  {
    "action": "Prescribe migraine-specific triptan",
    "explanation": "Graph shows node 'Migraine' occurring 3x/week; EMR confirms Sumatriptan was effective previously. This targets acute migraine attacks.",
    "priority": 0.95,
    "affected_nodes": ["Migraine"]
  },
  {
    "action": "Recommend rest and hydration",
    "explanation": "Graph shows node 'Fatigue'; transcript mentions low energy. Supportive care is low-risk and may improve symptoms.",
    "priority": 0.25,
    "affected_nodes": ["Fatigue"]
  }
]

IMPORTANT:
- Produce only valid JSON following the above structure.
- Do not include explanations outside the JSON.
- Do not invent new patient conditions; next steps must strictly relate to the annotated graph nodes.
- Only generate next steps that relate directly to the patient nodes provided in {NODES}.
- Do NOT invent new conditions or symptoms.
- Map each next step to one or more nodes from {NODES}.
- Consider EMR and transcript for context only, but do not hallucinate unrelated conditions.
