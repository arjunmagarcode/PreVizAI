Patient: Hi, I’ve been having a persistent headache for the past week, and sometimes I feel nauseous in the mornings.

System: Can you describe more about the times when you feel nauseous, such as what you're doing or eating before it happens?

Patient: Yes, I’ve noticed that my headaches get worse when I skip meals or spend a long time in front of a bright computer screen. Also, strong smells like perfumes or smoke sometimes make the nausea worse."

System: Have you noticed any changes in your vision or experienced any sensitivity to light along with your headaches?

Patient: Yes, I’ve noticed that my eyes feel strained after looking at screens for too long, and bright lights, like sunlight or fluorescent office lights, make my headaches worse. Sometimes I even get a bit of blurry vision when the headache is really bad."

System: Have you tried any treatments or remedies for your headaches and nausea, and if so, how effective have they been?

Patient Response: Yes, I’ve tried taking over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen, and they help a little, but the relief doesn’t last very long. I also tried drinking more water and resting, which sometimes helps slightly, but the headaches keep coming back
